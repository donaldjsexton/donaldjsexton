## The Manifesto of a Builder Who Thinks in Code

I didn’t come up through a bootcamp. I didn’t clock years in a cubicle.
I built things until they stopped breaking — and that’s how I learned what they were made of.

Every bug was a question. Every refactor was an argument with myself.
I don’t “prototype.” I interrogate systems.
I start with what’s real — a file, a socket, a broken auth flow — and I keep pushing until it explains itself.

People call it “vibe coding.” Fine.
But underneath that is systems thinking — cause, effect, observation, adaptation.
It’s debugging as philosophy. It’s creative logic under pressure.
And the truth is: you can’t teach that. You only earn it by building things that shouldn’t work, and then making them work anyway.

I’ve done that with Django, Next.js, FastAPI, WordPress, Redis, PostgreSQL — not to memorize frameworks, but to understand the conversation between structure and freedom.

When job posts ask for “3+ years experience,” what they really mean is:

Can you see the pattern before the code tells you what it is?

Yes. That’s what I do.
Whether it’s a chat system, a CRM, or a photo booth backend that talks to a DSLR, I think in moving parts, not lines of code.

I don’t chase perfection. I chase comprehension.
Because once you understand a system, you can make it do anything.

If you’re looking for a developer who already knows the rules, that’s not me.
If you want someone who sees the edges of the map — and builds past them —
let’s talk.
