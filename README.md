## Backend Web Developer — Reliability-Focused CRUD & Ingestion Systems

I’m a backend-leaning web developer (programming since 2024) focused on
persistence-first application design, deterministic ingestion workflows,
and predictable system behavior under real-world conditions.

My work emphasizes:
- idempotent processing & duplicate-safe uploads
- data-modeling discipline and relational integrity
- failure-aware engineering (no orphaned state, no silent corruption)
- incremental, traceable, team-ready development workflows


### Flagship Engineering Case Study

**Java Photo Gallery — Backend Ingestion & Persistence Platform**  
Java • Spring Boot • PostgreSQL • Flyway

- deterministic, restart-safe ingestion pipeline  
- hash-based duplicate detection & idempotent uploads  
- metadata extraction treated as non-blocking  
- persistence-first relational model (Image / Metadata / UploadHash / GalleryMembership)
- recoverable failure flows & operational documentation

Repo includes:
- `/docs/architecture.md`
- `/docs/upload-pipeline.md`
- `/docs/failure-handling.md`
- roadmap & sprint-style issues

> Designed to read like a production-minded backend project rather than a demo app.


### Areas I’m most interested in

- CRUD + auth workflows
- ingestion pipelines & data integrity
- persistence-first backend systems
- reliability, correctness, and stable iteration
