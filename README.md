# 👋 Hi, I'm Donald — I build systems that work as beautifully as they look.  

I’m an aspiring **Software Engineer** with a background in **web development, automation, and creative design**. Currently pursuing my **B.S. in Computer Science at WGU**, I focus on building projects that strengthen my skills in **JavaScript, React, and Python**.

## 🔧 Tech & Tools
- **Languages:** JavaScript (React, Node.js), Python, PHP, SQL  
- **Web:** HTML5, CSS3, WordPress, Elementor  
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** React, Next.js, WebdriverIO (learning Selenium)  
- **Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis (learning)  
- **Other:** Git/GitHub, Nginx, Docker (beginner)

## 📌 Pinned Projects

🔹 [**Photo Gallery**](https://github.com/donaldjsexton/photo-gallery)  
_A dependency-free image server written in **vanilla Node.js** — no Express, just file streams and pure HTTP._

🔹 [**Chat App**](https://github.com/donaldjsexton/chat-app)  
_Telegram-style real-time chat built with **Next.js**, **Socket.IO**, and **MariaDB**._

🔹 [**CRM**](https://github.com/donaldjsexton/CRM)  
_A **Django/FastAPI** prototype CRM for event management — focuses on automation, data integrity, and modular backend design._

🔹 [**HTTP Servers**](https://github.com/donaldjsexton/http-servers)  
_A series of **bare-bones servers** written in Python to explore sockets, request parsing, and response handling from first principles._

🔹 [**Bayes**](https://github.com/donaldjsexton/Bayes)  
_An experimental **Python** notebook exploring Bayesian inference and probability logic — part of an ongoing dive into applied mathematics._

## The Manifesto

I didn’t come up through a bootcamp. I didn’t clock years in a cubicle.
I built things until they stopped breaking — and that’s how I learned what they were made of.

Every bug was a question. Every refactor was an argument with myself.
I don’t “prototype.” I interrogate systems.
I start with what’s real — a file, a socket, a broken auth flow — and I keep pushing until it explains itself.

People call it “vibe coding.” Fine.
But underneath that is systems thinking — cause, effect, observation, adaptation.
It’s debugging as philosophy. It’s creative logic under pressure.
And the truth is: you can’t teach that. You only earn it by building things that shouldn’t work, and then making them work anyway.

I’ve done that with Django, Next.js, FastAPI, WordPress, Redis, PostgreSQL — not to memorize frameworks, but to understand the conversation between structure and freedom.

When job posts ask for “3+ years experience,” what they really mean is:

Can you see the pattern before the code tells you what it is?

Yes. That’s what I do.
Whether it’s a chat system, a CRM, or a photo booth backend that talks to a DSLR, I think in moving parts, not lines of code.

I don’t chase perfection. I chase comprehension.
Because once you understand a system, you can make it do anything.

If you’re looking for a developer who already knows the rules, that’s not me.
If you want someone who sees the edges of the map — and builds past them —
let’s talk.
